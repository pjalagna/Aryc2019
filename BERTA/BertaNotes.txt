- sequencing in berta
-- suppose we want to have a,b entered and then develop xa = a**2 + 2ab + b**2
--- clearly we need to sequence
---- we do this at e=>p time (ie when e executes p) p is a basii execution tree (Bpx) which holds that all v in Bpx are executed in a strict logical progression. so the berta progression is already b=>r=>t=>e=>p=>re=>ax=b'. it is at e=>p that an entry can be called to take and store [a] and [b] THEN the function can be called to develop and store [xa].

aside task is parsing table description into sql statements with data dictionary entries
format is:
<tableName> 
(( 
<keyName> of ( refTable.RefCol ) [ valueset ,+ ] ''' description ''' ,+ 
) 
<TagName> of ( refTable.RefCol ) [ valueset ,+ ] """ description """ ,+ 
) 
;

what to do with passed variables into worksheet.

YAWL is too complicated to use as a user driven format for medical devices. I believe BERTA has a smaller learning curve and therefore more intuitive.

a) all forms are tcl.
b) all processes are COTS POP python
c) all indexing and RI will be database driven except for:
c.1 ) subtype supertype rules
c.2 ) persistant queueing
c.3 ) execution of the BPX protocol
c.4 ) unless specified

d) design formats
- table definitions
-- TABLE <t-name> (( key ,+ ) tag ,+ ) ;

e) process definitions
-- bassi diagrams and BPX tables

rule form
list-bundle from bundle table + new
list-rule from rule table + new
test spread sheet
- each V-cell is list from test table + "rule..." + "number..." + "literal..." + "none"
- each op cell is "<<" "<" = != ">" ">>" + "none" + "is"
