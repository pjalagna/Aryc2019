YAWL is too complicated to use as a user driven format for medical devices. I believe BERTA has a smaller learning curve and therefore more intuitive.

a) all forms are tcl.
b) all processes are COTS POP python
c) all indexing and RI will be database driven except for:
c.1 ) subtype supertype rules
c.2 ) persistant queueing
c.3 ) execution of the BPX protocol
c.4 ) unless specified

d) design formats
- table definitions
-- TABLE <t-name> (( key ,+ ) tag ,+ ) ;

e) process definitions
-- bassi diagrams and BPX tables

rule form
list-bundle from bundle table + new
list-rule from rule table + new
test spread sheet
- each V-cell is list from test table + "rule..." + "number..." + "literal..." + "none"
- each op cell is "<<" "<" = != ">" ">>" + "none" + "is"
