file TCVR records
Paul Alagna

T: DS((ix) T,C,V,R)

simple database system
V datapoints are held along three dimensions C,T and R
and TCR is unique
analogis to T=Tables, R=ReferenceIndex == Keys, C=Column and V=values.

also analogis are:
records: seek(TR)=>[C] : all attached C in T @ R
domains: seek(C)=>[V] : all values of V
records of value seek(TCV)=>[R] : all keys where C=V in T

operators:
Write (DS,ix, T,C,V,R)
seek(DS,{T},{C},{V},{R}) to yield:
null => [t] all T in data set DS (the dominion)
T => [R] all Reference points in T
TC => [R] all reference points of C in T
TCV => [R] all reference points R where C = V in T
       IE all records where Name = Paul_Alagna
TR => [C] the record collection/structure of T @ R
TRC => V the one and only value V of C in T @ R
C => [V] the domain of values V that C can hold
R => [T] all the Tables that use R as their reference 
     EG side-car tables


2 other operations will operate on the Venn set
AND([R1],[R2])=> [Rx] all common [r]
AnotB([R1],[R2])=> [Rx] all uncommon of [R1]
- reversing AnotB([R2],[R1]) reveals uncommon of [R2]
