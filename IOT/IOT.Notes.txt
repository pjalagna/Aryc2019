webApp1.agent() 
1-reads mox.txt on a website
2- waits 10 seconds
3- reads mox.txt again
4- if the contents has changed it announces that
OR dies silently

meanwhile...
on.html redirects to a write function to change the contents to "on"
OR
off.html redirects to a write function to change the contents to "off"

if agent were connected to a line switch for a lamp that change could be used to switch that lamp on or off
