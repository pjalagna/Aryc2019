I Started with T1.xsd. A simple xsd that explained the following data relationship:
contact (( cid ) fname,lname,phone )
contacts(( ccids ))
contactPerContacts (( ccids,cid ))
Supplier (( sid )companyName,ccids )
Vendor (( vid ) companyName,ccids )

and behavior model:
NewSupplier (companyName,fname,lname,phone )
addToSupplier(companyName,fname,lname,phone )
DeleteSupplier(companyName)
NewVendor (companyName,fname,lname,phone )
addToVendor(companyName,fname,lname,phone )
DeleteVendor(companyName)

<function name=''>
    <inputParameter name=''/>
    <process>escaped text of process</
    <OutputParameter name=''/> <!-- void? -->
    <functionname>''</functionname>
</function>

this was rendered into an ontology of ATN, Relate and Function records

this ontology was then rendered into RDF statements
of the form
(1) RDF: subject predicate object OR
(2) Name: subject
(3) Predicate: name

for (1)
 subject could be:
(s1) "(" subject predicate object ")" OR
(s2) name
 predicate could be:
(p1) "(" subject predicate object ")" OR
(p2) name
 object could be:
(o1) "(" subject predicate object ")" OR
(o2) name

these RDF statements can be rendered into a Yed graph in a two step process.
(yed1) the RDF statements are rendered into nodes and edges arrays and 
(yed2) these arrays are rendered into a graphml file.
