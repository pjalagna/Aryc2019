namespace hiccup2

<Paola> pls say how did you process the file- </

I'm not sure what you meant by your question
but it sounded to me like "how did you get to realize this?" So, I'll answer that one.

Aside from the initial white space, the area of information for an XML / XSD document is the beginning brace character "<" up to but not including the next brace character "<"; inner split by a ">" token.

IE <stuff1>stuff2|"<" this "area of information" is also known as a "fragment"

The XSD standard has rules about what information items are contained in "stuff1" and "stuff2"

In "stuff1" attributies are recorded in the format attributeName="attributeValue". If an attribute name is further split into: 
namespaceName ":" localName then further processing is called for.

The XSD standard for namespaces says that a secondary XSD of that namespace exists and that a workflow (XSD fragment) for the localName will exist.

This is accomplished through 3 part mechanism:

1-the namaspace XSD file is declared in the schema statement using the "xmlns:" prefix such as <schema xmlns:foo="http//foo---" (oddly without the .xsd ending )

2- the namespace required is named in the attribute name AND/OR value. 
like: <element xsd:ref="foo:Fullname"
and 

3- that an XSD record exists in the namespace XSD:
IE <element name=localName-----..</element> existing in foo.xsd

In the parsing of a StratML XSD I found that:

The StratML.xsd calls for a stratml:Name and but the schema pointer "xmlns:stratml=" does NOT point to a valid URI.

This is from the StratML.xsd itself
xmlns:stratml="urn:ISO:std:iso:17469:tech:xsd:stratml_core"

After a little digging I made the assumption that the usage intended was to use the StratML.xsd as the secondary namespace XSD, in addition to being the guiding XSD for stratML XML reports.  Because the 
<element name="Name" XSD fragment does exist in this very document, I can continue on. "I" can continue because I'm a human.

Any automatic processes like the AIKR information extraction tools we are defining and building MUST follow the rules laid out by our standards and the standards we dictate.
