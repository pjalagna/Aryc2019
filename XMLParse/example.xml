To drive these management priorities, the Administration leverages Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals to coordinate and publicly track implementation across Federal agencies.</Description><OtherInformation>The President's Management Agenda sets forth a long-term vision for effective government on behalf of the American people focused on the following:

* Mission --
The American people count on the Federal Government every day, from national security to infrastructure to food and water safety. Public servants must be accountable for mission-driven results but must also have the necessary tools and resources to deliver.

* Service --
Federal customers range from small businesses seeking loans, to families receiving disaster support, to veterans owed proper benefits and medical care. They deserve a customer experience that compares to -- or exceeds -- that of leading private sector organizations, yet most Federal services lag behind the private sector.

* Stewardship -- 
Effective stewardship of taxpayer funds is a crucial responsibility of Government, from preventing fraud to maximizing impact. Taxpayer dollars must go to effective programs that produce results efficiently.</OtherInformation><StrategicPlanCore><Organization><Name>President of the United States</Name><Acronym>POTUS</Acronym><Identifier>_0d7c944a-1661-11e7-9683-0176647280a4</Identifier><Description/><Stakeholder StakeholderTypeType=""><Name/><Description/></Stakeholder></Organization><Vision><Description>... agencies deliver mission outcomes, provide excellent service, and effectively steward taxpayer dollars on behalf of the American people.</Description><Identifier>_b891e054-54ce-11e8-af73-ff4a5bf45d45</Identifier></Vision><Mission><Description>To set forth a long-term vision for effective government on behalf of the American people</Description><Identifier>_b891e28e-54ce-11e8-af73-ff4a5bf45d45</Identifier></Mission><Value><Name>Productivity</Name><Description/></Value><Value><Name>Security</Name><Description/></Value><Value><Name>Accessibility</Name><Description/></Value><Value><Name>Utility</Name><Description/></Value><Value><Name>Accountability</Name><Description/></Value><Value><Name>Service</Name><Description/></Value><Value><Name>Usability</Name><Description/></Value><Value><Name>Reliability</Name><Description/></Value><Value><Name>Trust</Name><Description/></Value><Value><Name>Results</Name><Description/></Value><Value><Name>Transparency</Name><Description/></Value><Value><Name>Innovation</Name><Description/></Value><Value><Name>Transformation</Name><Description/></Value><Value><Name>Predictability</Name><Description/></Value><Value><Name>Responsibility</Name><Description/></Value><Value><Name>Research</Name><Description/></Value><Value><Name>Innovation</Name><Description/></Value><Value><Name>Partnership</Name><Description/></Value><Goal><Name>IT</Name><Description>Modernize IT to Increase Productivity and Security</Description><Identifier>_b891e392-54ce-11e8-af73-ff4a5bf45d45</Identifier><SequenceIndicator>CAP1</SequenceIndicator><Stakeholder StakeholderTypeType="Person"><Name>Steve Censky</Name><Description>Goal Leader --
