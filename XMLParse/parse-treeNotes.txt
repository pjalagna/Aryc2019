i'm building a parse tree for xml using the xsd.
my use of xsd is sensitive to "<en" en name
if element, complex, sequence, choice , or none of the above

example 
mm = """<element name='contact'>
<complex>
<sequence>
<element name='fname' type='string' maxoccurs=1/>
<element name='lname' type='string' maxoccurs=1/>
<element name='phone' ref='phoneNumbers' minoccurs=0/>
</sequence>
</complex>
</element>"""

q - nesting conflict
can an xsd element have more than one child? unless that child is "complex"

ie can i parse <complex> to </complex> and know there is no nesting.

start:
mode = open
//init
parent=''
// modesw
;

modesw:
p1 -> t1! ...
